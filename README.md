# Auto Pipeline

This repository contains scripts for automating a content pipeline. Before running any scripts or the GitHub Actions workflow, install the project's Python dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The CI workflow also relies on this requirements file to set up the environment.
