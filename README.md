# Auto Pipeline

This repository contains scripts for collecting trending keywords, generating marketing hooks, and uploading them to Notion.

## Running Tests

Tests use `pytest` and are located in the `tests/` directory. To run all tests:

```bash
pytest
```

Ensure required dependencies are installed (e.g. `pytest`). Dummy modules are used so tests do not require external services.
