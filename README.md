## Recursive Kernel Modules

The `recursive_kernel` package implements experimental utilities that allow an AI
system to audit and redesign its own architecture using OpenAI's GPT models.

Modules include:

- `self_audit.audit_kernel` – reviews kernel code for redundancy, bottlenecks, ethical risks and optimizations.
- `meta_synthesizer.synthesize_new_kernel` – proposes a new kernel design based on audit feedback.
- `memory_evolver.evolve_from_memory` – suggests strategy evolution from past deployment logs.
- `fork_handler.fork_new_entity` – generates specifications for a new sub‑agent kernel.

These modules are prototypes and rely on the `openai` package.
