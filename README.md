# Auto Pipeline

This project contains scripts that generate marketing hooks and upload them to Notion.

## Environment setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project root.
2. Edit `.env` and provide the required credentials such as API keys and database IDs.

The `.env.example` file lists all environment variables used by the scripts so you know what to configure.
