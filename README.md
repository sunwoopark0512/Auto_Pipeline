## Security

- **Keep tokens in `.env` files** and never commit them to the repository. Environment files should be loaded at runtime to provide any required secrets.
- **Rotate API keys regularly** to minimize the risk from exposed credentials.
- **Check logs** to ensure tokens or other sensitive data are not printed or stored inadvertently.
