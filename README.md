# Auto Pipeline

This repository contains utility scripts for various automation tasks.

## Running Tests

Tests are written using `pytest`. After installing dependencies, you can run all
tests from the project root:

```bash
pytest
```

`pytest` will automatically discover tests in the `tests/` directory.
