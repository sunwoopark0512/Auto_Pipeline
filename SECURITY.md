# Security Strategy

This repository includes basic utilities for encryption, authentication and privacy management.

## Features

- **AES-256 Encryption** via `EncryptionUtil` to protect sensitive data.
- **JWT Authentication** using `JWTAuthentication` for API access control.
- **GDPR/CCPA Compliance** with `PrivacyManager` to handle data deletion requests.

These utilities can be found in `security_utils.py` and are intended to be integrated into the pipeline where sensitive data is processed.
